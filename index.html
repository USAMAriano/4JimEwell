        	<h2>Ordnance Power Solutions provides</h2>
            <p>Engineering Design services for the specification, design, development, qualification and production
            of Electro-Explosive Devices (EEDs) and Thermal Batteries which are used mostly for military applications. Knowledge and use of these unique devices is something
            not learned through any formal education institution but only acquired by experience.</p>
            <p>The company acts as a seamless bridge between the manufacturer of EEDs and Thermal Batteries and the end user ensuring a successful integration

                     	<h4>Owner's Background</h4>
                        <p>Jim Ewell served 4 years in the US Navy where he was trained and worked as an Electronics Technician on
                        aircraft radar systems. After the Navy Jim pursued formal education and received a Bachelor of Electrical
                        Engineering Degree from Fenn College of Engineering at Cleveland State University. Jim continued Graduate
                        engineering studies at Northeastern and Boston University in Electrical engineering and Computer Engineering.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                     	<h4>Early Work Experience</h4>
                        <p>Jim started work at a major defense contractor in the Boston area on surface to air missile electronic systems for
                        the US Army. Jim next worked at a defense contractor in Ann Arbor, Michigan making US Air Force communications satellites
                        and also worked on grants with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics lab on non-detectable ASW systems from US Navy air borne
                        platforms. Later Jim worked for an OEM supplier of electronic control and sensor modules for the three largest
                        automobile manufacturers in Detroit. This provided Jim with high volume design and manufacturing production experience.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                     	<h4>Specific EED & Thermal Battery Experience</h4>
                        <p>The majority of Jim's 32 years of experience involved a smart anti-tank weapon for the US Air Force.
                        The system utilizes over 100 EEDs of 7 different types and over 50 thermal batteries of 4 different types in which Jim was involved
                        and/or responsible for every phase from initial specification to final system level acceptance testing.</p>
                        <p>Jim was considered the resident expert for these devices prior to his retirement. Jim formed his own company to assist this new generation of engineers
                        employed at the end user defense contractors. Jim also can be utilized by the original manufactures of EEDs and Thermal
                        batteries to understand the intended end use so the correct product can be designed and delivered.</p>
                     </li>

                      <li>
                     	<h4>Recognition in Professional Forums</h4>
                        <p>Jim's knowledge in understanding how Thermal Batteries should be used was captured in a paper he authored and presented at
                        an International Power Sources Conference which is held every other year to identify the latest advances in battery and other power sources.</p>
						<p>Jim also participated in as industry forum, hosted by the United States Undersecretary of defense to understand and address the criticality of
						the supply chain of EEDs and Thermal batteries for support of the US defense sector.</p>
                     </li>

					  <li>
						<h4>International Experience</h4>
						<p>Jim has acquired years of international experience with foreign developers and manufacturers of EEDs and Thermal Batteries
						which could be the perfect conduit for either a US end user seeking a foreign supply source or a new developer internationally
						trying to enter the US market place. Jim is familiar with the challenges the end user can face which trying to source internationally
						especially trying to meet any Offset Obligations.</p>
